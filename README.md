# What is seamate?

Seamate is an add-on for [Seahub](https://github.com/haiwen/seahub), the web interface of the file syncing and sharing software [Seafile](https://github.com/haiwen/seafile), that allows the easy modification of Seahubâ€˜s look.

With seamate you can change:
* the used font
* the colors of the text and the links
* thickness and color of the borders
* the background image of the login screen

# Do you have an example?

The changes can be done directly in the admin area of seahub.

Virtually every Seahub graphic element can be changed. There are virtually no limits to freedom.

Also, the home page is redesigned with seamate to allow larger logos.
